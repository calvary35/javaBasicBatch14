Java Class 7 review

switch (variable){

case value1:
			code A;
			break;
case value2:
			code B;
			break;
default:
			code C;
			break;
}
Limitations:
	data type: Cannot work with double, float, long, boolean
	cannot work with relational and logical operations
	
Loops - reduce code redundancy

int time =11;

if(time<12){

System.out.println("good morning");

}
WHILE time<12){

System.out.println("good morning);

}*this will run infinitely because 10 is < 12

WHILE loop syntax
	while(boolean condition){
		code to be repeated;
}

DO WHILE loop

do while loop syntax

do{

			code to be repeated;

}while(boolean condition);

WHILE vs DO WHILE --> both loops executed while condition is true

while loop first CHECK condition -> if true -> executes code DO WHILE first EXECUTES code --> then checks condition


FOR Loops syntax

for(initialization; condition ; increment/decrement){

		code to be repeated;
}

//Hello 5 times
for(int i=1; i<=5; i++){

System.out.println("Hello");
}

When to use which loop:

When we know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE FOR LOOP

When we do not know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE WHILE LOOP OR DO WHILE LOOP
