Collections Framework:
    Collection framework is collection of multiple classes and interfaces which help us process the data efficiently
    and easily.

Why we should learn about it?
    1.It is very flexible
    2.Provide ready-made methods that we can use.

What is the Syntax?
    Its similar how we create the object of any class, but we use <> to specify the name of the class whose
    object we are going to store in that class.

Issues with Collections Framework:
    1. Collections framework does not work with primitive datatypes(solution is use wrapper classes).

NOTE: Frequently asked in interviews!!!

Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types.

Boxing:
    converting the primitive datatype to its corresponding wrapper type by explicitly calling methods.
     //boxing or manual conversion from primitive to wrapper type
            //Integer wrappedNum= Integer.valueOf(num);

Auto Boxing:
    converting the primitive datatype to its corresponding wrapper type by simply assigning the values.
  Integer wrappedNum = 10;

Unboxing:
    Converting a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive type by explicitly calling a method.
    //unboxing converting a wrapper type to a corresponding primitive type
            //int num2=wrappedNum().intValue();

Auto Unboxing:
    converting a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive type automatically by assigning the value.
   Integer wrappedNum= new Integer(10);
    int num2 = wrappedNum;
