FileHandling in Java:
    Reading, writing, and manipulating files using java code is called fileHandling.

Why we should learn FildeHandling:
    1. When we perform data driven testing we need to store data in the files.
    2. Sorting critical data like userNames or passWords inside the code is bad because when we push the code
       that info will also be pushed with it, to avoid this we use properties files.
    3. Sometimes data can be huge(gigabytes) and it is very bad practice to push (gibytes)  to github.

How can we read data from a file?
    1. First we need to know the location(path) of the file.
    2. Navigate to that location where file is stored.
    3. We need a special class/Software that can help us read/write to that file.
