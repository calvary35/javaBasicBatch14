Java Class 8

Loops in Java:

while
do while
for
enhanced for loop/for each loop/ advanced for loop

FOR LOOP - when we know number of repetitions/iterations in advance

	FOR(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
	
		code to repeat;
	
	}

WHILE LOOP and DO WHILE Loop -> if we don't know number of repetitions

WHILE LOOP vs DO WHILE

	WHILE checks condition first -> then executes code
	DO WHILE executes code -> then checks the condition
	
WHILE LOOP SYNTAX	
WHILE(condition) {
		code to repeat;
}

DO WHILE LOOP SYNTAX
DO{

}WHILE(boolean condition);

BREAK- breaks the loop and it is usually used inside some type of conditions

CONTINUE-continues to the next iteration/cycle
	moment Java sees continue-> it goes back to the beginning of the loop
	it is usually used inside some type of conditions
	
NESTED LOOPS - loop inside another loop

for(int i=1;i<3;i++){ ---> outer loop
	
	System.out.println("Hello");
	
	for(int j=1; j<=3; j++){ --> nested loop
	
		System.out.println("Bye");
		
	}
}
