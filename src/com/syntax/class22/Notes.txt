Method Overriding:
    Allows us to have same name methods in parent and child classes.
Why we should override a method?:
    Let's say we are inheriting from a Parent class that has 10  methods. We like 8 of them and want to reuse 8
    of the methods, however we don't like 2 of them we want to provide implementation in a different way.
    We can use method overriding to override those methods.
What is the syntax to override a method:
    We simply redefine the method in the child class
