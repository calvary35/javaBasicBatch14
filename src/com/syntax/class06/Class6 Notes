Logical AND &&- all conditions MUST be true for logical and return TRUE

Logical OR || - at least 1 condition MUST be true or return logical TRUE

Logical NOT ! - Reverses condition in booleans- True is now false, False is now True

You can initialize variables by having them equal to 0
	For example: int largest = 0;
	
Compiler always checks out code before giving it to JAVA to execute it.

Compiler can initialize variables to it's default values:

int = 0;
double= 0.0;
boolean = false;
String and other non-primitives = null;

double d = 10;
System.out.println(d);

Switch statement - statements that executes one statement from multiple values/conditions

SYNTAX

SWITCH (variable){

	case value1:
			code A;
			break;
	case value2:
			code B;
			break;
	default:
			code C;
			break;
}

   //switch case is a value based 
   // it knows the value -> jumps into matching case
  //matching cases must be of same data type as the variable
  //No duplicated case in switch cases
  //Limitations of Switch Case
  		*switch case cannot use logical operators
  		*switch case cannot use relational operators
  // Cannot work with boolean values
  //CE: Cannot switch on a value of type boolean.
  //Cannot work with float/double and long
