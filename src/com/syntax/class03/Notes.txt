	String Concatenation- 
		*Helps us combine two Strings together
		Only + sign is defined when trying to combine a string and integer
		*For example: "if we subtract 10 from 5 we get=" + 5; this would compile
		*For example: "if we subtract 10 from 5 we get = " + 10-5; would not compile
		
	Arithmetic Operations-
		*Double is accurate up to 15 places after the decimal point
		*Float is accurate up to 6-7 places after the decimal point

	Type Casting
		*If right side part of data type is smaller than left side , java will compile.  
		But if the right side data type is bigger than left side of data type we have to convert it.
		
	*Why we should learn type casting
		
		When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code from others to save time
		We use it so that we can use the code that is written by someone else to make our life easier
		We might also need to convert the data types to make our code compatible with their code
		
	*What is the syntax for type casting?
		We use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for example
		if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we can do it.
		
		long var1 = 250;
		int var2 = (int)var1; // Its Explicit/Narrowing/Manual typecasting
		double var3=var2 // Implicit/Widening/Automatic typecasting
		
		float f=250.5f;
		double d=f; //Implicit/Widening/Automatic typecasting
		
		
		
	*When we are converting something smaller to larger we don't need to do anything
		it compiles automatically- 
		
		int box=1234;
		
		long box2=box;// this is how it works and it is called implicit or widening automatic conversion
		
		*However when we are converting a larger data type to a smaller data type then we have to assign the data type in the parenthesis()
		
		long box=1255453535;
		
		int box2= (int) box; this is called narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
===========================================================================================		
	Relational & Equality Operators
		< Less Than
		> Greater Than
		<= Less Than Or Equal To
		>= Greater Than Or Equal To
		== Equal To
		!= Not Equal To

	If Else Conditions
		If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
		
	Why we should learn about if else?
		Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website our programs 
		need to make a lot of decisions.
		
		If (the given username and password matches)
		{go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}
		
	What is the syntax for If Else Conditions
		boolean isHungry=true;
		
		if(isHungry){
		System.out.println("Please Eat Something");
		}else{
		System.out.println("Lets build some java programs");
		}
