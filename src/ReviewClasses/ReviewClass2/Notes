Type casting:
	Type casting is converting the type of date from one data type to another one. We have two types of type casting.
		1. Explicit/Narrowing/Manual 	2.Implicit/widening/automatic
		
		When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one is is called Explicit/narrowing/Manual
		
		And when we go from a smaller data type to a larger data type we call it Implicit/Widening/Automatic.
		
		1. byte(8), 2. short(16), Char(16), 3. int (32), 4. long(64), 5. float(32), 6.double(64) *(parenthesis represent number of bits
		
	Why we need type casting?
			
			When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types.When we are working with math some time
			we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only interested in the non-decimal part.
			
	What is the syntax?
		Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
			int box = 1000;
			byte box2 = (byte) box;
		
		Implicit/widening/Automatic
			int box = 10000;
			double box2 = box;

If Statements:

		IF else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decisions based on some condition and provided data.
		
		If condition
		If else condition
		If else if condition
		nested if else condition

Why we should learn about if else conditions
	When we are solving real life problems like testing a website out program needs to make a lot of decisions
	
What is the syntax of if else conditions?
	if condition
	
	boolean rich=true;
	if(rich)
	{
	System.out.println("Lets buy a Jet Island");
	}		
	
	
Nested If Conditions 

* 	are conditions which are dependent on each other if outer condition is
	not true, inner condition is never checked.
	inner conditions are only checked when outer condition is passed.
