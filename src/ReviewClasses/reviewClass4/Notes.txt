Arrays:
		Arrays are consecutive memory locations which store
		same type of data.
Why we need arrays?
	Arrays help us store large amounts of data in a single 
	variable. For example if we want to store the names of
	100 students we don't need to create 100 variables, we can simply
	create an array of size 100 and it will store the names.
	
Syntax(how to use):
	Data type[] name of array = new data type[size]
	Data type[] name of array = new data type[]{store the elements}.
	For example an int array that stores three numbers.
	int[]arr=new int[]{10,20,3};
