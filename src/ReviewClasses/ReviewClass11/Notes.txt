HashTable:
    HashTable is previous version of HashMap. HashTable is thread safe. It uses synchronization to achieve
    thread safety and because of this it is slow as compared to HashMap.

Why we should use HashTable:
    As a tester it is very rare that we will be writing multi-threaded code and if we don't write multithreaded code
    but still use HashTable it will make our code slow for no benefit.

Difference between HashMap and HashTable:
    HashTable is thread safe while HashMap is not.

Maps:
    How can we iterate through a map


Important concepts for your coding tests:
If else conditions
Loops
Arrays
String class methods
ArrayList
Maps

Important concepts for verbal interviews:
OOPS


For Frameworks:
    1.how classes work for example how to create a class how to declare
        instance variables how to use them inside methods
    2.Go through all the concepts of methods
    3.Types of variables like instance static(you will be using heavily)
    4.Inheritance

FileHandling in Java:
    Reading, writing, and manipulating files.

Why we should learn about file handling?
    1.We don't store sensitive data inside the code it might get exposed when we push the code to github.
    2.Hardcoding the data or credential in code is a very bad practice because for any reason if you have to change
        the credentials or that data you will have to change it everywhere which will take a lot time.
    3.When we have to perform data driven testing we use a lot of data to perform this type of testing it is not
        feasible to put all of that data in code.

Steps to Read from any file in Java:
    1.First we need the location(path)
    2.Use a class to navigate to that location(for example FileInputStream)
    3.We need a class that can help us read/write data to that special type of file for example for .properties file
        we use Properties class and for excel we use XSSFWorkbook
