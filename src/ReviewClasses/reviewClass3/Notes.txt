Logical Operators:
	Logical operators help us test more than one condition. In java we have &&
	as the AND operator and || OR operator and ! NOT.

Why we should learn Logical Operators?
	Logical operators help us reduce the number of if-conditions that we write in certain cases.
What is the syntax?
	if(condition1 && condition2)}
	
	{
	if(condition1){
		if(condition2){
	syso("Hello");
	}
	}
Switch case: 
	Similar to if else if conditions.

Why should we learn about the switch case?
1.its cleaner code
2. its faster than if conditions
